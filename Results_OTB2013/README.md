# Gate Connected Convolutional Neural Network for Object Tracking
## IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)- 2017


## Abstract 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed
in visual tracking due to their rich levels of feature representation.
While the learning capability of a CNN increases
with its depth, unfortunately spatial information is diluted in
deeper layers which hinders its important ability to localise
targets. To successfully manage this trade-off, we propose a
novel residual network based gating CNN architecture for object
tracking. Our deep model connects the front and bottom
convolutional features with a gate layer. This new network
learns discriminative features while reducing the spatial information
lost. This architecture is pre-trained to learn generic
tracking characteristics. In online tracking, an efficient domain
adaptation mechanism is used to accurately learn the
target appearance with limited samples. Extensive evaluation
performed on a publicly available benchmark dataset demonstrates
our proposed tracker outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
